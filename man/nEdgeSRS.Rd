\title{
Compute the total sample size for a simple random sample based on an Edgeworth approximation
}
\description{
Compute the total simple random sample size that is large enough to insure adequate coverage of a normal approximation confidence interval (CI) for a population mean.
}
\usage{
nEdgeSRS(ci.lev, side, epsilon = 0.005, dat, pop.sw = TRUE, wts = NULL, hcol=NULL, ycol)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ci.lev}{
    desired confidence level for a 1- or 2-sided normal approximation confidence interval based on an estimated mean; must be in the interval (0,1)
}
  \item{side}{
    either \code{"two.sided"} or \code{"one.sided"} for type of confidence interval
}
  \item{epsilon}{
    tolerance on coverage probability; the sample should be large enough that CI coverage is within \eqn{\pm} \code{epsilon} of \code{ci.lev}; must be in the interval (0,1)
}
  \item{dat}{
    either a population or sample data frame
}
  \item{pop.sw}{
    TRUE if \code{dat} is for a full population; FALSE if \code{dat} is for a sample
}
  \item{wts}{
    vector of weights if \code{dat} is a sample; if \code{dat} is for a population, \code{wts = NULL}
}
  \item{hcol}{
    column of \code{dat} that contains the stratum ID; strata can be character or numeric
}
  \item{ycol}{
    column of \code{dat} that contains the analysis variable; must be numeric
}

\details{
\code{nEdgeSRS} computes the total sample size needed in a simple random sample so that the coverage probability of a confidence interval is within a specified tolerance (\code{epsilon}) of a nominal confidence level (\code{ci.lev}). Confidence intervals for the finite population mean are usually computed using the normal approximation whose accuracy depends on the sample size and the underlying structure of the analytic variable. In some applications, assuring that CIs have near nominal coverage is critical. For example, for some items on business tax returns the US Internal Revenue Service allows sample estimates to be used but sets precision standards based on the lower (or upper) limit of a 1-sided CI.

Using an Edgeworth approximation in Sugden, Smith, and Jones (SSJ, 2000) to the distribution of the estimated mean, \code{nEdgeSRS} computes the total sample size needed so that a CI will have coverage equal to the nominal value in \code{ci.lev} plus or minus the tolerance \code{epsilon}. Two alternatives are given: (1) a sample size from solving quadratic equation (4.4) in SSJ and (2) a modification of a rule from Cochran (1977) given in expression (4.3) of SSJ. If \code{hcol} is specified, a separate calculation is made in each stratum of the required stratum simple random sample size; thus, each stratum sample size should be adequate so that the normal approximation for each stratum estimator holds. The calculation assumes that the overall or stratum sampling fractions are negligible.

When \code{dat} is a sample, the weights (\code{wts}) used in the estimator of the mean (or total) are assumed to be scaled for estimating population totals. They can be inverse selection probabilities, i.e. ones used in the \eqn{\pi}-estimator, or weights that have been adjusted to account for nonresponse or coverage errors.

The remainder term in the approximation used in \code{nEdgeSRS} is \eqn{O(n^{-1})}. In contrast, the function \code{nEdge} uses a \eqn{O(n^{-1/2})} approximation but applies to an overall mean from a stratified simple random sample for which several different allocations can be specified. The total sample size returned by \code{nEdge} is based on the overall Edgeworth approximation for the distribution of the population mean estimator; the resulting stratum sample sizes may not be large enough so that the normal approximation is adequate for each stratum estimator.
